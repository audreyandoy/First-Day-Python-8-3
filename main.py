# print("Hello World")

# # VARIABLE - a way to store a single piece of data.
# # ex: Score and Health in games.

# #nameofvariable = value
# Score = 0
# name = "Spongebob"
# health = 100.405679

# print(name)

# #CONDITIONALS - if/else statements used for decision-making

# if Score == 5:
#   print("your score is 5")
# else:
#   print("score is 0")
# num = 30
  

# # Create an if/else statement that will print
# # whether num is less than or greater than 30.
# if num > 30:
#   print ("greater than 30")
# elif num == 30:
#   print ("num equals 30")
# else:
#   print("num equals 30")

# # LOOPS: a way to repeat code for a given amount of times or until a condition is met

# for i in range(5):
#   print("smelly cat")

# count = 0 
# while (count < 9):
#   print("The count is: " + str(count))
#   # count = count + 1
#   count += 1
